### Hello and thanks for visiting my GitHub page! 👋

👨 I am a software engineer with experience in a range of languages, frameworks and methodologies.

⚡ This includes Java, Python, AWS, Content Management Systems, Serverless, SQL, Spring Boot and many others.

🌱 In the technical landscape, I have other interests that include using Data Science and Machine Learning to solve problems, discover insight and automate tasks.

⛳ Outside of tech I am a keen follower and player of sports, such as football, tennis and golf, as well as an average musician - and I'm always looking to combine my interest in these with my skills in tech.
