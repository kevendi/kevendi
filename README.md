### Hello and thanks for visiting my GitHub page ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ‘¨ I am a software engineer with experience in a range of languages, frameworks and methodologies.

â›³ Outside of tech I am a keen follower and player of sports, such as football, tennis and golf, as well as an average musician - and I'm always looking to combine my interest in these with my skills in software development.
